# Lemmings Remake 

Previously I've created a copy of Lemmings (code found in https://github.com/llNorthPolell/lemmings-remake) using pure HTML and JavaScript. 
I have recreated it using PhaserJS 3 and React to learn and practice PhaserJS and JavaScript ES6. I have stopped working on this as I feel
I have achieved learning the basics of PhaserJS 3.

## Tech Stack:

- React and Vite - Front End Base 
- PhaserJS 3  and TypeScript - Game Logic
- Tiled Map Editor - level data
- OpenGameArt.org - Spritesheets and Textures


## Possible Future Work:

- countdown timer for self-destruct
- main menu scene
- slope logic
- lemming bridge building task
- lemming climbing task
